## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# This is not a header
summary(cars)
```

## Regular Code

```r
# Regular markdown code (not run)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

# Plots

## Including Plots {#plots-are-here .class-foo}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
